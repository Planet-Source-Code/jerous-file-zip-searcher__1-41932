## File Zip Searcher


</div>

### Description

How many times haven't you had the problem you were looking for a file inside a zip but didn't know where that 

----

zipfile was? With File Searcher you don't have that problem anymore!

This little program (which resembles to the Windows search for quick familiarity) will search in all zipfiles (no other archives yet supported. If you have one I can use, please mail me).

Much thanks to Richard (richard@richsoftcomputing.co.uk) for his zip dll.

I would appreciate some comments, Thank you
